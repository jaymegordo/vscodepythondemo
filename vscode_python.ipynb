    "- **Code Editor** - A view which displays the active text/code file. Could be python, text, markdown etc.\n",

I use the command palette _very_ frequently, likely 10-20 times per hour.\n",

    "\n",
    "The file launcher is similar to the command palette, (its actually the exact same, but launched without the leading \">\"). This is the fastest way to jump to any of your files (open or closed), and can be launched with `cmd + p`. Start typing the name of a file and press enter to open.\n",

    "## Jupyter Interactive Window\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, as promised, we'll talk about (in my opinion) the most important yet least obvious and most overlooked feature of vscode when developing in python - the Jupyter Interactive Window.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's hard to overstate the value of the interactive window. Combined with the fact that vs code doesn't open in a browser (gross), this feature is what makes vs code so fast/easy/painless to do everything from testing out a couple lines of code, to building complete applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "The interactive window is a [REPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read–eval–print_loop) environment, and runs a standard Jupyter kernel under the hood. You can set it to use any of your conda or pipenv environments (highly recommend), or just let it use your base python installation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Settings\n",
    "\n",
    "More settings! To help the interactive window achieve it's full potetential, we'll add a few things to `settings.json`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```json\n",
    "    \"files.autoSave\": \"onFocusChange\",\n",
    "    \"jupyter.notebookFileRoot\": \"${workspaceFolder}\",\n",
    "    \"jupyter.runStartupCommands\": [\n",
    "        \"%load_ext autoreload\",\n",
    "        \"%autoreload 2\",\n",
    "        \"%config Completer.use_jedi = False\"\n",
    "    ],\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- `onFocusChange` tells vscode to save any file editor as soon as your cursor moves out of the frame.\n",
    "- `notebookFileRoot` sets jupyter to set its cwd to your workspace root folder, which is important so we can access our files/packages easily.\n",
    "- `runStartupCommands` tells jupyter to reload your files whenever they change on disk, which lets us quickly edit files and test them out in the interactive window.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you should be able to lauch an interactive window, and import your modules/functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "With a directory structure like:\n",
    "```\n",
    "RootFolder\n",
    "├── my_package\n",
    "│   |── __init__.py\n",
    "|   └── my_module.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can import modules and call functions with:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from my_package import my_module as mm\n",
    "mm.my_function()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "<img src=\"./images/jupyter_example.png\" width=\"1000\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
